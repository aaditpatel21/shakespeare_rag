🎭 Shakespeare RAG: High-Precision Hybrid Retrieval Engine

An advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system capable of answering complex queries about Shakespeare's works with High Precision and High Recall.

Unlike naive RAG systems, this engine employs a Two-Stage Hybrid Pipeline (Dense + Sparse Retrieval) followed by a Cross-Encoder Re-ranker to solve the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon and handle specific quote retrieval.

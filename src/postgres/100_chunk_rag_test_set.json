Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb Which hides your life and shows not half your parts. If I could write the beauty of your eyes And in fresh numbers number all your graces, The age to come would say 'This poet lies: Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.' So should my papers yellow'd with their age Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue, And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage And stretched metre of an antique song: But were some child of yours alive that time, You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.",

You swore to us,\nAnd you did swear that oath at Doncaster,\nThat you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;\nNor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,\nThe seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:\nTo this we swore our aid. But in short space\nIt rain'd down fortune showering on your head;\nAnd such a flood of greatness fell on you,\nWhat with our help, what with the absent king,\nWhat with the injuries of a wanton time,\nThe seeming sufferances that you had borne,\nAnd the contrarious winds that held the king\nSo long in his unlucky Irish wars\nThat all in England did repute him dead:\nAnd from this swarm of fair advantages\nYou took occasion to be quickly woo'd\nTo gripe the general sway into your hand;\nForget your oath to us at Doncaster;\nAnd being fed by us you used us so\nAs that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,\nUse",

The British camp near Dover.'}\n\nStage Instructions: Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND,  KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain, Soldiers,  & c\n\n\nEDMUND:\nSome officers take them away: good guard,\nUntil their greater pleasures first be known\nThat are to censure them.\n\nCORDELIA:\nWe are not the first\nWho, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.\nFor thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;\nMyself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.\nShall we not see these daughters and these sisters?\n\nKING LEAR:\nNo, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:\nWe two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:\nWhen thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,\nAnd ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,\nAnd pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh\nAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues\nTalk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,\nWho loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;\nAnd take upon's the mystery of things,\nAs if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,\nIn a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great one",
